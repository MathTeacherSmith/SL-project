         An International Baccalaureate (IB) School is a school authorized to offer one or more of the International Baccalaureate programs. The IB is an internationally recognized educational foundation that provides a challenging curriculum aimed at developing students' intellectual, personal, emotional, and social skills for a globalized world.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="sub-section">
          I went to an IB School from the 10th to 12th grade. I believe that my life would be different mostly because it really prepared me for college and made the next 5 years of my life easier.
        </p>
        <p class="sub-section">
          I was TERRIBLE at writing essays. The IB school mostly prepared me to write essays at the college level.

        <h2>Biggest Strugles</h2>
        <p class="sub-section">
          One of my biggest struggles in the IB Program was completing the extended essay. I wrote about the golden ratio (approximately 1.618).  
        </p>
        <p class="sub-section">
          I also struggled with community service. I was never part of a program that included service and I also lived far away from the school so it was hard to attend events outside of school time.
